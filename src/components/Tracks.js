        // The line below is the same as saying if (this.state.playing === false) just by putting an exclaimation mark
        // Note: false = playing, true = not playing
        // PROBLEM: Original object when clicked on playing. Click again the same song play over the same one
        // SOLUTION: notice we added audio into state: null -> we can refer to that to pause. 
        // TAKE AWAY LESSON  we can use boolean to solve these kind of problems

        // everytime CLICK happens -> new audio get recreated 
              // We want to pause the origial audio object: Not the new one
                // Then keep track of the current audio state so we can pause that one later



        // NEXT PROBLEM: It takes 1 click to pause - 1 click on the next to play the next song
               // We want one click on the next album and plays straight away.
        // STEPS: When click -> pause existing song -> get the next click object -> play that
               // The idea is if they click on the same album we know to pause 
                  // If they click on a different previewURL we want to pause and play that previewURL
